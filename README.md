> Hello, World...
### My name is Natalie
*Web developer and part-time blacksmith*

I taught myself programming during lockdown because I liked solving puzzles - and I kept it up because I love system design.

Graduated (with academic honours) from Centennial College's Software Engineering Technician program in April 2025 and keeping myself busy putting it to use making little web apps. 

Completed:
1. [Table-Top Game Character Builder](https://character-builder-next.vercel.app/) ([git](https://github.com/arbocobra/character-builder-next))
2. [Portuguese Verb Flashcards](https://verb-application-client.vercel.app/) ([git](https://github.com/arbocobra/verb-application))
3. [Minesweeper](https://arbocobra.github.io/redux-minesweeper/) ([git](https://github.com/arbocobra/redux-minesweeper))

In progress:
1. [That My MP??](https://that-my-mp.vercel.app/) - Who's my MP and what do they vote for? Next steps include incorporating data on Bills in voting record. Built with Next.JS using OpenParliament API ([git](https://github.com/arbocobra/that-my-mp))

*(From September 2024 - April 2025 I was required to use a separate GitHub account while attending college, that is why there is a large gap in my commit history)*
