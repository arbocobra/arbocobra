> Hello, World...
### My name is Natalie
*Web developer and part-time blacksmith*

I taught myself programming during lockdown because I liked solving puzzles - and I kept it up because I love system design.

Graduated (with academic honours) Centennial College's Software Engineering Technician program in April 2025 and keeping myself busy putting it to use with little web apps. 

Completed:
1. [Portuguese Verb Flashcards](https://verb-application-client.vercel.app/) ([git](https://github.com/arbocobra/verb-application))
2. [Minesweeper](https://arbocobra.github.io/redux-minesweeper/) ([git](https://github.com/arbocobra/redux-minesweeper))

In progress:
1. That My MP? - Who's my MP and what do they vote for? Built in Next.JS using OpenParliament API ([git](https://github.com/arbocobra/that-my-mp))
